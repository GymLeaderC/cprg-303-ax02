### A React Native mobile application built with Expo, recreating the Spotify Mobile application interface with multi-screen tab and stack navigation.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment requires students to design and implement a professional multi screen mobile application using Expo. Working in groups of three, students will recreate the layout and navigation structure of a real world mobile application, demonstrating technical proficiency, collaborative development, and professional coding practices.

## Project Instructions

- Select a real mobile application interface (e.g., Instagram, X, banking or shopping app).
- Capture screenshots of at least three related screens.
- The reference must demonstrate moderate to high interface complexity. Simple designs will not be accepted.

## Project Setup

- Assign a meaningful project name and organize your files clearly.

## Screen & Navigation Requirements

- Implement a minimum of FOUR (4) functional screens.
- Use Tab Navigation combined with at least one Stack Navigation flow.
- Each screen must include structured layout, icons, and consistent styling.
- At least one screen must include dynamic content such as lists, navigation parameters, or reusable components.

## Team Collaboration (Groups of Three)

- Each group must contain exactly three students.
- All members must contribute code to the GitHub repository.
- Commit history will be reviewed to ensure equitable participation.

## Bonus (Optional – Up to 2 Extra Marks)

- Implement light/dark theme support
